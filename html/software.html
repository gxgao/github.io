                    The program is a simple Stock Analyzer. It web scrapes
                    for stock info and graphs it in a custom built 
                    tkinter graphing interface. It also has the feature 
                    to use multivariate regression to build a linear,
                    and a polynomial regression model with time as the x-axis
                    and price on the y-axis (The idea is to find trends over time).
                    Additionally, it pulls, from the web, stock fundamentals 
                    (p/e ratio, volume, ROA etc.) so that they can be easily accessed. 
                    Furthermore, it analyzes the price chart and points out major 
                    price fluctuations and uses a stock news API to get correlated news 
                    for that price change. There is also an industry average 
                    analyzer that, given a market cap and industry, it finds all 
                    relevant companies and pulls the average values for each of 
                    their fundamentals. This can then be used to compare individual 
                    stocks within the industry to get a better financial sense of
                    how a company is doing. This practice is commonly used in 
                    accounting for horizontal and trend analysis.

                This was a team project under the name Stone-Face-Emoji &#128511; 
                completed for the Hack 112 competition at Carnegie Mellon University. 
                <u>The project placed 2nd in the awards ceremony.</u>
                <br>
                <u>Contributors: George Gao, Shivank Joshi, Bryce Yeazell</u>
                <br>
                The project's goal was to analyze a given excerpt and 
                then tell the user what genre that excerpt came from.
                <br>
                The project ran in 3 parts. The first part was webscraping. 
                This was handled by me (George). The code simply ran through 
                a website gathering excerpts from books of popular genres 
                and assimulated them into a text file. This was done with the 
                help of selenium, beautiful soup, and requests.
                <br>
                The second part handled processing all the data to build 
                a database for each genre of a book and was handled mostly 
                by Shivank. He used TextBlob to read and analyze the 
                excerpts and assigned 'scores' to each excerpt based 
                on a few different catagories such as gramatical syntax,
                sentence structure, etc. He stored the scores in a seperate 
                text file.
                <br>
                The final part, the UI was designed by Bryce. 
                We used a modified tkinter module designed by Carnegie Mellon University. 
                It prompts users to enter an excerpt, and would return an image,
                as well as a guess as to which genre the excerpt had came from. 
                Updated UX was done by me (George) to bug fix some UI problems.
                <br>
                Note: This project is far from perfect as it was the first
                'large' project I attempted. Thus the analyzer does not always work.
                Further note, the longer a given excerpt to analyze the higher
                the change it will be closer to what the original book is. 
                </p>

                    The above image demonstrates the simple UI of the program.
                    After inserting an excerpt from a Lord of the Rings passage,
                    we are greeted with the program's guess as to what genre the
                    passage best fits to. In this case, the program states that
                    the passage fits the horror genre.
